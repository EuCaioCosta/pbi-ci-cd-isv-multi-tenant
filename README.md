## What is this?  

This repository is a compilation of various other repositories from Microsoft experts and the community, along with documentation from Microsoft Learn, forums, and articles. It demonstrates the use of a CI/CD scenario for Microsoft Power BI PRO projects by utilizing [fabric-cli](https://aka.ms/fabric-cli) and GitHub Actions.  

The scenario envisions a project where, after deployment, the solution is distributed across multiple tenantsâ€”each with its specific data source and user configurationâ€”making it ideal for ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) who build SaaS applications for their customers, as shown in option 4 of the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/manage-deployment).

## Instalation 

- Fork this repo  
- Configure required GitHub secrets 

|Name|Value|  
|---|---|  
|FABRIC_CLIENT_ID|Service Principal Client ID from Entra App ID|  
|FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET|Service Principal Secret from Entra App ID|  
|FABRIC_TENANT_ID|Tenant ID|  
|ISV_TENANT_A|FABRIC_CLIENT_ID\|FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET\|FABRIC_TENANT_ID|  
|ISV_TENANT_B|FABRIC_CLIENT_ID\|FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET\|FABRIC_TENANT_ID|  
|ISV_TENANT_C|FABRIC_CLIENT_ID\|FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET\|FABRIC_TENANT_ID|  

If you run locally, configure same secrets on your environment variables and install the `fab-cli` with:  

```bash
$ pip install ms-fabric-cli
```

- Configure  the file `config.json` with ids by branch.  
  - The  adminUPNs are the Object ID of the Entra User Principal Name.  

- Configure the file `config-isv.json` with ids for each tenant.  


## CI/CD Pipeline  

- The PBIP files are saved in the `src` folder with the extensions `*.Report` and `*.SemanticModel`.  
- Deploying new versions is done on the `dev` branch.  
- On every push to `dev`, the GitHub Actions pipeline is triggered, deploying to the `*-DEV` workspace with the name and data source specified in `config.json`.  
- Once the development phase is complete, a pull request is created for the `staging` branch, where the pipeline triggers deployment to the `*-STG` workspace and also runs the best practices analysis pipeline `bpa.yml`. This process utilizes community tools such as [Tabular Editor](https://github.com/TabularEditor/) and [PBI-Inspector](https://github.com/NatVanG/PBI-InspectorV2).    
- Once the project is approved, a pull request is created for the `main` branch, where the pipeline will deploy the version to all tenants specified in `config-isv.json`.
